## Welcome to my personal website!


I am Konstantin Tkachuk: entrepreneur, researcher and web3 enthusiast. I am excited about the opportunities that decentralization brings to the daily life of our digital world and focus on Web3 governance research and applications. Additionally, I help startups around the world in business and technology advisory capacity. I also co-founded an NGO to foster equal youth access to education and self-realization opportunities.

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
